-- Q1. It was 11:47 PM when Rakesh, the head of Flipkart's marketplace integrity team, 
-- got a frantic call from the CEO. "We've got sellers gaming our system," the CEO said. 
-- "Some of them are creating multiple supplier accounts and artificially inflating their 
-- product rankings by cross-purchasing." Rakesh needs to identify suppliers whose products 
-- appear suspiciously often in the same orders as products from other suppliers with 
-- similar naming patterns. For each supplier, he needs to: (a) rank them by the frequency 
-- their products appear in multi-supplier orders, (b) identify the rank of their most common 
-- "co-supplier" partner, and (c) flag suppliers where their top co-supplier's products have 
-- very similar price points (within 5% when both products' price ranks are compared within 
-- their respective categories). The board meeting is at 8 AM and he needs this analysis now.

-- Q2. Zomato's new CFO, Priya Mehta, just finished her first quarterly review and discovered 
-- something alarming. She noticed that certain stores seem to have excellent sales figures 
-- but terrible profitability, while others have the opposite pattern. "I need to understand 
-- our portfolio health," she told her team. She wants a "store health matrix" that ranks 
-- each store on four separate dimensions: (1) revenue rank within its region, (2) profit 
-- margin rank within its region (using revenue_summary), (3) employee productivity rank 
-- (revenue per employee) within its region, and (4) customer satisfaction rank (average 
-- review rating of products sold at that store) within its region. For each store, she wants 
-- to see all four ranks side by side, plus a flag indicating if any rank differs from the 
-- others by more than 10 positions - these are the "inconsistent" stores that need investigation. 
-- The board presentation is tomorrow and she needs stores categorized as: "Stars" (all ranks 
-- in top 25%), "Concerns" (any rank in bottom 25%), and "Inconsistent" (rank variance > 10).

-- Q3. BigBasket's supply chain director, Amit Sharma, was reviewing vendor contracts when 
-- he realized the company might be overly dependent on certain suppliers for critical 
-- product categories. He remembered reading about how Toyota's production once halted 
-- because of a single supplier failure. Now he needs a comprehensive "supplier risk assessment" 
-- that considers multiple factors: (a) For each category, rank suppliers by their market share 
-- (sales volume of their products in that category), (b) For each supplier, calculate a 
-- "criticality score" based on: the number of categories where they rank #1 or #2, the 
-- total revenue at risk if they failed (sum of their products' sales), and the availability 
-- of alternatives (count of other suppliers in the same categories), (c) Finally, create a 
-- "risk priority rank" that combines these factors. Amit needs to present this to the 
-- procurement committee next week, and they specifically want to see the top 10 highest-risk 
-- supplier dependencies and suggested mitigation strategies based on the data patterns.

-- Q4. Late one Thursday evening, Myntra's customer experience head, Neha Kapoor, received 
-- concerning feedback from the customer success team. "We're getting complaints that our 
-- recommendations seem random," her team lead said. "Customers feel like we don't understand 
-- their preferences." Neha decided to validate this by building a "recommendation accuracy" 
-- analysis. For each customer, she needs to: (a) identify their category preferences by ranking 
-- categories by the customer's purchase frequency in each, (b) compare these personal category 
-- ranks with the overall category popularity ranks in the system, (c) calculate a "uniqueness 
-- score" - customers with very different personal ranks vs. overall ranks have unique tastes 
-- and need personalized recommendations, while those whose ranks match the overall pattern 
-- can receive popular item recommendations. She wants customers segmented into: "Mainstream" 
-- (personal ranks correlate with overall), "Unique" (personal ranks diverge significantly), 
-- and "Explorers" (shop across many categories with no clear preference pattern). Each segment 
-- needs its own row numbering, and she wants the top 100 customers from each segment for 
-- a focus group study.

-- Q5. Amazon India's loss prevention team discovered a potential fraud pattern at 3 AM. 
-- Their monitoring system flagged that certain product-store combinations had suspiciously 
-- high return rates, but when investigated individually, nothing stood out. The pattern only 
-- emerged when looking at rankings. The team leader, Vikram Reddy, hypothesizes that fraudsters 
-- are systematically buying and returning products from specific stores in a way that stays 
-- just below detection thresholds. He needs a query that: (a) ranks products by return rate 
-- within each store, (b) ranks stores by return rate within each region, (c) identifies 
-- "intersection anomalies" - cases where a product ranks in the top 10% for returns at a 
-- specific store, AND that store ranks in the top 20% for returns in its region, AND the 
-- product's return rank at that store is significantly worse than its return rank across 
-- all stores. These triple-intersection cases need to be flagged with the severity based 
-- on how extreme the rank differences are. Vikram needs results before the morning standup.

-- Q6. Swiggy's HR director, Anjali Krishnan, was conducting her annual workforce planning 
-- review when she noticed something puzzling about salary distributions. Some departments 
-- seemed to have very compressed salary ranges while others had extreme spreads. She 
-- suspects this might be creating retention issues. She needs an analysis that: (a) ranks 
-- employees by salary within their department, (b) ranks employees by salary within their 
-- role across all departments, (c) calculates a "equity flag" for employees whose department 
-- rank differs from their cross-department role rank by more than 5 positions (suggesting 
-- they're paid differently than peers in the same role elsewhere), (d) identifies "compression 
-- zones" - groups of 3+ consecutive employees (by salary rank) whose salaries differ by 
-- less than 5%, and (e) ranks departments by the severity of their compression issue (count 
-- of employees in compression zones / total employees). The CHRO wants a presentation showing 
-- which departments need immediate compensation review and which employees might be flight risks.

-- Q7. PhonePe's product strategy team is preparing for a quarterly business review, and the 
-- VP of Product, Karthik Iyer, wants to understand the "product portfolio dynamics." He 
-- explains: "I want to see which products are rising stars, which are cash cows, and which 
-- are dogs, but I don't want simple revenue buckets. I want to see movement patterns." 
-- He needs an analysis that: (a) ranks products by revenue in Q1 2024 (or available period), 
-- (b) ranks the same products by revenue in Q2 2024 (or next period), (c) calculates "rank 
-- velocity" - how many positions each product moved between periods, (d) categorizes products 
-- as "Rockets" (moved up 10+ ranks), "Risers" (moved up 3-9 ranks), "Stable" (moved ±2 ranks), 
-- "Fallers" (moved down 3-9 ranks), and "Crashers" (moved down 10+ ranks), (e) within each 
-- category, further ranks products by absolute revenue to prioritize attention. He wants 
-- the final output to show the top 20 products in each movement category with their full 
-- rank trajectory.

-- Q8. Ola's finance team just discovered a significant variance in their monthly expense reports. 
-- The controller, Meera Nair, suspects that some stores are misclassifying expenses to game 
-- their performance metrics. She needs a forensic analysis that: (a) for each store, ranks 
-- expense categories by their share of total store expenses, (b) creates a "benchmark profile" 
-- by calculating the average rank of each expense category across all stores in the same region, 
-- (c) identifies "anomaly stores" where any expense category's rank differs from the regional 
-- benchmark by more than 3 positions, (d) for each anomaly, calculates the "severity score" 
-- based on the magnitude of the rank difference weighted by the expense amount, (e) ranks 
-- stores by their total anomaly severity score. The audit committee meeting is in 48 hours 
-- and she needs a list of the top 15 stores requiring immediate audit review with detailed 
-- breakdown of which expense categories are flagged and why.

-- Q9. Paytm's growth team is analyzing customer acquisition effectiveness across marketing 
-- channels. The marketing director, Rahul Menon, has a theory: "Customers acquired through 
-- different channels have different lifetime values, but we've never quantified this properly." 
-- He needs an analysis that: (a) for each customer, determines their "acquisition cohort" 
-- based on their join_date month-year, (b) calculates total customer spending, (c) ranks 
-- customers by spending within their cohort, (d) analyzes if customers from certain cohorts 
-- consistently rank higher in spending (suggesting better acquisition quality during those 
-- periods), (e) further partitions by region to see if cohort quality varies geographically. 
-- He wants to identify the top 5 "golden cohorts" (cohort-region combinations where the median 
-- customer ranks in the top 30% of all-time spending) and the bottom 5 "weak cohorts" for 
-- channel strategy adjustment. The analysis should use CTEs to build up the cohort rankings 
-- progressively.

-- Q10. IRCTC's inventory management system flagged multiple alerts simultaneously, causing 
-- the operations center to scramble. The inventory director, Suresh Kumar, needs to prioritize 
-- which alerts to address first. He wants a sophisticated "alert triage system" that: 
-- (a) ranks products by stockout urgency (current stock / average daily sales, with lower 
-- values more urgent), (b) ranks products by revenue impact (average order value when product 
-- is included), (c) ranks products by customer impact (number of distinct customers who've 
-- bought the product), (d) creates a composite "alert priority score" using weighted ranks 
-- (urgency 50%, revenue 30%, customer impact 20%), (e) identifies "cascade risks" - products 
-- whose stockout might affect related product sales (products frequently bought together), 
-- (f) final ranking considering both individual priority and cascade risk. He needs the top 
-- 25 products with their complete rank breakdown for the emergency response team.

-- Q11. Reliance Retail's merchandising team is preparing for the annual store planogram 
-- optimization. The merchandising head, Deepika Patel, wants data-driven shelf space 
-- allocation. She needs an analysis that: (a) ranks products by sales within their category, 
-- (b) ranks products by profit margin within their category, (c) ranks products by purchase 
-- frequency (number of transactions, not quantity), (d) creates a "shelf priority score" 
-- combining all three ranks with weights, (e) partitions this by store to create store-specific 
-- rankings (as product performance varies by location), (f) identifies "must-stock" items 
-- (top 10% across all dimensions at a store), "consider dropping" items (bottom 20% across all), 
-- and "optimize placement" items (high on some dimensions, low on others). For each store, 
-- she wants the product assortment categorized into these three buckets with supporting rank data.

-- Q12. Flipkart's customer segmentation model is being rebuilt by the analytics team. 
-- The analytics lead, Prashant Joshi, believes the current RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) 
-- model is too simplistic. He proposes an enhanced "RFMCD" model adding Category breadth 
-- and Discount sensitivity. He needs: (a) Recency rank - customers ranked by days since last 
-- order (most recent = rank 1), (b) Frequency rank - customers ranked by order count, 
-- (c) Monetary rank - customers ranked by total spending, (d) Category rank - customers ranked 
-- by number of distinct categories purchased (breadth), (e) Discount rank - customers ranked 
-- by average discount percentage on their orders (least discount-dependent = rank 1, as they 
-- pay full price). For each customer, calculate their average rank across all 5 dimensions, 
-- then rank customers by this average to create a "composite value score." Segment customers 
-- into: "Champions" (composite rank in top 5%), "Loyal" (top 20%), "Potential" (top 50%), 
-- "At Risk" (bottom 50%), and show the distribution of original dimension ranks within each 
-- segment to understand segment characteristics.

-- Q13. Zomato's delivery operations team is facing driver shortages in certain areas during 
-- peak hours. The operations head, Arjun Singh, needs to optimize driver deployment by 
-- understanding demand patterns at a granular level. He needs: (a) for each store, rank hours 
-- of the day by order volume, (b) for each store, rank days of the week by order volume, 
-- (c) identify "super peak" combinations (day-hour combos that rank in top 3 for both dimensions 
-- at a store), (d) calculate the demand concentration - percentage of weekly orders that occur 
-- during these super peaks, (e) rank stores by demand concentration (higher concentration = 
-- easier to staff efficiently), (f) identify "nightmare stores" - stores with low concentration 
-- (spread-out demand) AND high total volume (requiring many drivers but unpredictably). 
-- The driver allocation model needs the top 10 nightmare stores with their complete demand 
-- profile for special handling.

-- Q14. BigBasket's category management team is conducting their annual category review. 
-- The category director, Lavanya Sharma, wants to evaluate category managers' performance 
-- objectively. She needs: (a) for each category, calculate metrics: total revenue, revenue 
-- growth (if historical data available, otherwise inventory turnover), customer count, 
-- average basket size when category is present, (b) rank each category on each metric, 
-- (c) create a "category health score" as weighted average of ranks, (d) rank category managers 
-- by the average health score of their managed categories, (e) identify "turnaround opportunities" - 
-- categories where some metrics rank well but overall health ranks poorly (suggesting specific 
-- improvement areas), (f) flag categories where the rank on customer count significantly 
-- exceeds the rank on revenue (suggesting lots of customers but low spending, indicating 
-- price or assortment issues). The presentation should show each category's complete rank 
-- profile with manager attribution.

-- Q15. Myntra's fraud detection system generated 847 alerts last month, overwhelming the 
-- investigation team. The fraud manager, Ravi Shankar, needs a smarter prioritization system. 
-- He needs: (a) for each customer, calculate their "normal behavior profile" - rank patterns 
-- for order value, order frequency, category preferences, and payment modes, (b) for recent 
-- orders, calculate the "deviation score" - how different the order's characteristics rank 
-- compared to the customer's normal profile, (c) rank orders by deviation severity, (d) weight 
-- this by order value (high deviation + high value = critical), (e) further flag orders where 
-- the shipping address has no previous orders (new address + high deviation + high value = 
-- maximum priority), (f) segment alerts into "Critical" (top 5%), "High" (top 20%), "Medium" 
-- (top 50%), and "Low" with expected investigation time estimates based on complexity. 
-- The team can only investigate 50 alerts per day, so he needs the prioritized queue with 
-- all supporting rank data.

-- Q16. Amazon India's pricing team discovered that competitors are using dynamic pricing 
-- algorithms that respond to Amazon's prices within hours. The pricing strategy head, 
-- Nandini Rao, needs to identify which products are most vulnerable to competitive pricing 
-- pressure. She needs: (a) rank products by price volatility (if price history available, 
-- otherwise use discount variance as proxy), (b) rank products by market share within category 
-- (sales volume as share of category), (c) rank products by price sensitivity (how much sales 
-- rank changes when discount rank changes - requires comparing two time periods), (d) identify 
-- "price war vulnerable" products - high market share + high price sensitivity + competitors 
-- present in category (multiple brands), (e) rank these vulnerable products by the potential 
-- revenue at risk (current sales × average price), (f) segment into "Defend" (must maintain 
-- market share), "Concede" (not worth fighting), and "Attack" (opportunity to gain share). 
-- The strategy team needs the top 30 products in each segment with complete competitive 
-- positioning data.

-- Q17. Swiggy's regional expansion committee is evaluating new cities for market entry. 
-- The expansion head, Sanjay Deshmukh, wants to use existing market data to predict new 
-- market potential. He needs: (a) for existing markets (cities), calculate performance metrics: 
-- orders per customer, average order value, customer acquisition rate (new customers/month), 
-- (b) rank cities on each metric, (c) create a "market maturity score" as weighted rank average, 
-- (d) identify "reference cities" for each potential new city based on demographic similarities 
-- (population proxy via postal codes, region), (e) calculate "expected performance rank range" 
-- for new cities based on how reference cities performed in their early months, (f) rank 
-- new city opportunities by the gap between expected potential and current resources required. 
-- The board presentation needs the top 5 expansion candidates with comparative data to 
-- similar existing cities and expected ROI ranking.

-- Q18. PhonePe's vendor management team is renegotiating contracts with 200+ suppliers. 
-- The procurement director, Anand Kumar, needs data to support negotiation strategies. 
-- He needs: (a) rank suppliers by total business value (revenue from their products), 
-- (b) rank suppliers by product quality (average customer ratings), (c) rank suppliers by 
-- reliability (return rate of their products - lower is better), (d) rank suppliers by 
-- uniqueness (number of product categories where they're the only or primary supplier), 
-- (e) create a "supplier power score" - suppliers with high uniqueness rank have more power, 
-- (f) create a "replacement difficulty score" - considering uniqueness, quality, and volume, 
-- (g) segment suppliers into "Strategic Partners" (high value + hard to replace), "Leverage 
-- Opportunities" (high value + easy to replace, so we can negotiate hard), "Nurture" 
-- (low value now but high quality, invest in growing relationship), and "Transactional" 
-- (commoditized, pure price negotiation). Each segment needs different negotiation playbooks.

-- Q19. Ola's executive team is preparing for the annual strategy offsite. The CEO wants to 
-- understand organizational health through the lens of employee data. The CHRO, Kavitha Reddy, 
-- needs: (a) rank departments by average salary (compensation competitiveness), (b) rank 
-- departments by salary spread (max-min) as a ratio to average (equity within department), 
-- (c) rank departments by attendance rate (engagement proxy), (d) rank departments by 
-- employee count growth (if derivable, otherwise static count), (e) create a "department 
-- health score" combining these metrics, (f) identify "warning departments" - high salary 
-- rank but low attendance rank (paying well but not engaged), or low salary rank but high 
-- attendance rank (engaged but underpaid - flight risk), (g) for each warning department, 
-- identify the specific employees who contribute most to the concerning pattern (their 
-- individual ranks vs. department averages). The board deck needs a visual-friendly output 
-- showing department rankings with color-coded health indicators.

-- Q20. Paytm's customer lifecycle team is building a churn prediction model. The data science 
-- manager, Shreya Menon, needs behavioral features that capture rank changes over time. 
-- She needs: (a) for each customer, calculate their order value rank in their first 3 months, 
-- (b) calculate their order value rank in months 4-6, (c) calculate the "rank trajectory" - 
-- improvement or decline in rank position, (d) similarly calculate rank trajectories for: 
-- order frequency, category diversity, and average days between orders, (e) create a composite 
-- "engagement trajectory score" from these individual trajectories, (f) identify "silent 
-- churners" - customers whose trajectory scores are declining but who haven't stopped ordering 
-- yet (early intervention targets), (g) segment by trajectory pattern: "Growing" (positive 
-- trajectory), "Plateau" (stable trajectory), "Declining" (negative trajectory), "Churned" 
-- (no recent orders). The model training dataset needs these trajectory features for all 
-- customers with at least 6 months of history.

-- Q21. IRCTC's dynamic pricing team wants to implement surge pricing during high-demand 
-- periods. The revenue management head, Vikram Sharma, needs demand pattern analysis: 
-- (a) rank each day-hour combination by order volume for the past year, (b) rank by average 
-- order value for the same combinations, (c) identify "opportunity windows" - time slots 
-- that rank high on volume but lower on order value (customers are buying, but not spending 
-- much - might accept premium options), (d) identify "premium windows" - time slots that 
-- rank high on order value (customers already spending more - maintain experience), 
-- (e) for each store, calculate the rank of each time slot relative to that store's pattern 
-- (localized surge detection), (f) create a "surge pricing eligibility score" considering 
-- volume rank, local demand pattern, and customer price sensitivity (derived from discount 
-- usage patterns). The pricing committee needs the complete time-slot-store matrix with 
-- surge eligibility rankings.

-- Q22. Reliance Retail's omnichannel team is analyzing customer behavior across touchpoints. 
-- The digital head, Arun Krishnamurthy, wants to understand channel preferences: (a) for 
-- customers with multiple addresses, rank addresses by order frequency, (b) for customers 
-- with orders at multiple stores, rank stores by their preference, (c) for customers with 
-- multiple payment modes, rank modes by usage frequency, (d) create a "channel loyalty score" - 
-- customers who consistently use the same top-ranked options across dimensions are loyal, 
-- those who vary are flexible, (e) identify "channel migrators" - customers whose rankings 
-- have changed significantly over time (comparing first half vs. second half of their history), 
-- (f) segment into "Store Loyalists," "Address Flexible," "Payment Explorers," and "Omnivores" 
-- based on the combination of loyalty scores across dimensions. Each segment needs specific 
-- engagement strategies.

-- Q23. BigBasket's assortment optimization AI is being trained by the data team. The ML 
-- lead, Pooja Nair, needs comprehensive product affinity features: (a) for each product pair 
-- that appears together in orders, calculate co-occurrence frequency, (b) rank product pairs 
-- by co-occurrence within category (intra-category affinity), (c) rank product pairs by 
-- co-occurrence across categories (cross-category affinity), (d) for each product, identify 
-- its "affinity profile" - the ranks of its top 5 companion products, (e) identify "bridge 
-- products" - products that rank highly in cross-category affinity (customers buying these 
-- often explore other categories), (f) identify "anchor products" - products that when present, 
-- significantly increase the order value rank of the order, (g) create a "merchandising 
-- priority score" for each product based on its bridge and anchor potential. The recommendation 
-- engine needs this affinity matrix for collaborative filtering.

-- Q24. Myntra's personalization team is debugging why recommendations are underperforming. 
-- The personalization lead, Rohan Jain, suspects there's a "cold start" problem with new 
-- products. He needs: (a) for products launched in the last 6 months, calculate their 
-- current sales rank within category, (b) calculate their rating rank (if they have ratings), 
-- (c) identify "invisible products" - new products that rank poorly on sales but should 
-- rank higher based on category trends, (d) for each invisible product, find similar 
-- "visible products" (same category, similar price rank) and compare their rank trajectories, 
-- (e) calculate a "visibility debt" score - the gap between expected rank (based on similar 
-- products' performance) and actual rank, (f) rank new products by visibility debt to 
-- prioritize for marketing push, (g) segment the recommendation issue: "Discovery Problem" 
-- (high quality but low visibility), "Quality Problem" (visible but poor ratings), or 
-- "Pricing Problem" (visible and rated but price rank doesn't match value perception).

-- Q25. Amazon India's fulfillment network optimization team is redesigning inventory 
-- allocation. The network planning head, Srinivas Rao, needs: (a) for each product-store 
-- combination, calculate the "service level" - how often the product is in stock when 
-- ordered (derived from returns with reason "out of stock" or inventory levels vs. sales), 
-- (b) rank product-store combinations by service level within each product (which stores 
-- serve this product best), (c) rank by service level within each store (which products 
-- does this store handle best), (d) identify "allocation opportunities" - product-store 
-- combinations where the store ranks well overall but poorly for specific products 
-- (suggesting they should receive more inventory), (e) identify "consolidation opportunities" - 
-- products where few stores rank well (concentrate inventory), (f) calculate "network 
-- efficiency score" - the degree to which high-demand stores have high-service-level 
-- inventory, (g) simulate reallocation impact by calculating what ranks would change if 
-- inventory moved from low-rank to high-rank locations. The operations council needs 
-- the top 50 reallocation recommendations with expected impact.

-- Q26. Swiggy's competitive intelligence team monitors market positioning. The strategy 
-- analyst, Divya Krishnan, needs: (a) rank product categories by market size (total sales), 
-- (b) rank categories by growth rate (comparing periods), (c) rank categories by profitability 
-- (margin proxy), (d) rank categories by competition intensity (number of brands, supplier 
-- concentration), (e) create a "category attractiveness score" combining these dimensions, 
-- (f) identify "strategic battlegrounds" - categories that rank high on size and growth 
-- but also high on competition (worth fighting for), (g) identify "hidden gems" - categories 
-- that rank high on profitability but low on competition (protect and nurture), (h) identify 
-- "exit candidates" - categories with poor ranks across all dimensions. The strategy 
-- presentation needs a visual portfolio matrix with each category positioned and labeled 
-- by its strategic role.

-- Q27. PhonePe's customer service optimization team is analyzing support ticket patterns. 
-- The customer success director, Ramesh Iyer, needs: (a) rank customers by ticket volume 
-- (support burden), (b) rank customers by ticket severity (if available, otherwise by 
-- resolution time as proxy), (c) rank customers by lifetime value, (d) identify "high-value 
-- high-maintenance" customers - those who rank in top 20% on both support burden and LTV, 
-- (e) identify "low-value high-maintenance" customers - high support rank but low LTV rank, 
-- (f) calculate "service ROI rank" - LTV rank minus support burden rank (positive = profitable 
-- to serve), (g) for high-value high-maintenance customers, analyze their support patterns 
-- to identify root causes (correlate with product categories, payment modes, etc. using 
-- rank analysis). The customer success playbook needs segment-specific strategies based 
-- on service ROI rankings.

-- Q28. Ola's product launch effectiveness is being analyzed by the product marketing team. 
-- The PMM lead, Megha Sharma, needs: (a) for each product launched in the past year, 
-- calculate week-over-week sales rank trajectory for the first 8 weeks, (b) classify launch 
-- trajectories as: "Blockbuster" (consistently improving rank), "Flash" (high initial rank 
-- that declined), "Sleeper" (low initial rank that improved), "Dud" (consistently poor rank), 
-- (c) for each trajectory type, calculate the average marketing spend (if derivable from 
-- campaigns/promotions during launch window), (d) identify "overmarketed duds" - products 
-- with high campaign exposure rank but dud trajectory, (e) identify "undermarketed sleepers" - 
-- products with sleeper trajectory despite low marketing rank, (f) calculate "launch 
-- efficiency score" - rank improvement per marketing dollar proxy. The launch playbook 
-- needs data-backed recommendations on marketing spend levels for different product types.

-- Q29. Paytm's returns optimization team is analyzing return patterns for process improvement. 
-- The returns manager, Anita Desai, needs: (a) rank products by return rate within category, 
-- (b) rank products by average days to return (fast returns suggest immediate quality issues, 
-- slow returns suggest wrong expectations), (c) rank return reasons by frequency within 
-- each product (what drives returns for each product), (d) identify "quality issue products" - 
-- high return rate rank + "defective" reason ranks highly, (e) identify "expectation gap 
-- products" - high return rate rank + "not as expected" reason ranks highly, (f) identify 
-- "size issue products" - high return rate rank + "wrong size/fit" reason ranks highly, 
-- (g) for each issue type, calculate the cost impact (return volume × refund amount) and 
-- rank by remediation priority, (h) create a "returns reduction roadmap" prioritizing 
-- by cost impact rank and issue type (different fixes for each). The quality team needs 
-- the top 20 products for each issue category with root cause data.

-- Q30. IRCTC's seasonal planning team is preparing for the festive season. The planning 
-- head, Sunita Rao, needs: (a) analyze last year's festive period (Oct-Dec) and rank 
-- products by sales volume growth vs. non-festive baseline, (b) rank products by 
-- inventory stockout frequency during festive period, (c) rank products by return rate 
-- increase during festive period (rushed buying leads to more returns), (d) identify 
-- "festive stars" - products that rank high on sales growth and low on stockout and 
-- return issues, (e) identify "festive nightmares" - high sales growth but also high 
-- stockout and return ranks, (f) for each store, rank categories by festive importance 
-- (share of festive sales vs. annual sales), (g) create "festive readiness score" for 
-- each product-store combination based on: expected demand rank, current inventory rank, 
-- and historical issue rank. The operations team needs the bottom 50 readiness scores 
-- (highest risk product-store combinations) to prioritize pre-festive preparation.

-- Q31. Reliance Retail's customer analytics team is building a next-generation loyalty 
-- program. The loyalty program director, Vivek Menon, needs: (a) rank customers by 
-- current loyalty points (explicit loyalty), (b) rank customers by purchase consistency - 
-- standard deviation of monthly spending (implicit loyalty), (c) rank customers by 
-- brand concentration - what percentage of their purchases are from their top 3 brands, 
-- (d) rank customers by promotion responsiveness - correlation between their purchase 
-- timing and promotion periods, (e) create a "loyalty character profile" for each customer:
